Image Classification by Dominant Color

This is my graduation project at the Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering (CSEDU), "Ss. Cyril and Methodius" University, Skopje.
It is a Java implementation of a simple collor classification by dominant color algorithm. There are several approaches I'm testing
1. Reducing the importance of the pixel the farther it is from the center of the image
2. Applying filters to smooth out the image
3. Using different techinques to count the pixel as belonging to one or different color
