CSEDU_DomColorClassification by Blagoj Atanasovski
===========================================

Image Classification by Dominant Color

This is my graduation project at the Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering (CSEDU), "Ss. Cyril and Methodius" University, Skopje.
It is a Java implementation of a simple collor classification by dominant color algorithm. There are several approaches I'm testing<br/>
1. Reducing the importance of the pixel the farther it is from the center of the image<br/>
2. Applying filters to smooth out the image<br/>
3. Using different techinques to count the pixel as belonging to one or different color
